# Randomized DrumSynths (.ds file) Generator
Aims to create random values for .ds DrumSynth Files.

.ds files and its support have been originated in the [2000s](https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/blob/master/src/core/DrumSynth.cpp) and and later released for public implementations by the original author.

I tried to randomize the values for the .ds file struture and and hence mass production of different kinds of noises is possible.
But not all files produce are of very good quality sounds, and some will cause LMMS to crash.

Here are some selected .ds files in this project.

Randomizer written in PHP, but the values needs to be improved.
